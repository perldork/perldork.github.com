Recently at my job our teams have grown to include a number of people
who are not co-located with us.  Here are some of the tools we've been
using that have helped us develop and design together across locations.

### Social coding

* [Gitlab](http://gitlab.org/) - Github-like UI on top of git.  Many of
  the same features of Github, pretty easy to host internally.

### Remote pair programming

* [Screenhero](http://www.screenhero.com) - by far the best remote
graphical pair-programming tool I've found - includes streaming audio
support so we don't have to have Google Hangouts, Skype, or another
audio application open as well.
* [Hastebin](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) - a paste bin
  tool that runs on node and is easy to set up internally - fast, low
  memory usage, zero maintenance.

### Remote design 

* [ASCII Flow](http://www.asciiflow.com/) - java-based, open source
  ASCII diagramming tool.  Great for cutting and posting diagrams into
  markdown files.  Haven't tried installing it internally yet.
* [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/) - near-real time collaborative,
  modeless editing tool - like Google docs, highlights each person's
  text in a different color.  Runs on node as well.

### Remote communication

We've heard a lot about various team-oriented chat tools, for now we've
been sticking to the basics and so far so good.

* IRC
* [AIM blast bots](http://blast.aim.com/)
